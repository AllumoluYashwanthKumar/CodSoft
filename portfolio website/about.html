                <h2>Hello, I'm A. Yashwanth Kumar</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree at KL University. I'm passionate about software development, particularly in areas such as software testing, verification, and validation. My goal is to become a skilled software engineer who contributes to building high-quality software products.

                <p>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy learning new things and am always looking for opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my little sister and exploring the latest trends in technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to connect or collaborate on a project!
